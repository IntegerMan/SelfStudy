# The Semi-Supervised Learning Program for Prospective Technomancers
This is **The Semi-Supervised Learning Program for Prospective Technomancers**, a completely made-up, non-accredited, and ridiculous name for a serious effort at self-directed targeted independent studies.

## Why am I building this?

Instead of paying tens of thousands of dollars and 5 years of my life for a Doctorate of Engineering degree with classes oriented towards research purposes, I thought instead I would formally study these matters independently.

Essentially, I want to identify common focal areas that you'd see as core requirements or electives in traditional degrees.

And, while I'm learning myself, I wanted to share my approach with the community so others could investigate and learn things themselves.

## What's the approach?

Each course should take between 1 and 4 months, depending on the breadth of the topic and depth of study needed. Each course should consist of mandatory reading material from multiple academic texts and research papers as well as one or more in-depth practical or research project accompanied by a public-facing article and/or presentation on the topic.

Additional blog post or video content creation should be emphasized as a way of internalizing the studied materials.

Additionally, courses should be augmented with one or more online courses through MOOC platforms like Coursera or Udemy where available, but these should serve as supplementary ways of reinforcing the main concepts learned through literature.

## Where do I start?

Nowhere, yet, but keep watching because more content is coming soon as it gets defined!

Current programs of study include:

- [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial%20Intelligence.md)

## Who is this for?

This program is intended to assist individuals looking to self-study advanced AI, ML, and engineering topics for their own skills development outside of a university setting.

This approach should retain the same mechanical underpinnings focus found in literature and course studies while also keeping practical applications in mind through real-world projects of my own choosing.

This is not a free program - academic texts are expensive, as are online courses, but it is one that offers flexibility in learning and learning approaches and should facilitate skills and knowledge development while creating public content for others to learn from.

This is also not a program intended to be respected by others in the community, land you a job, or land you a promotion. It goes without saying that **The Semi-Supervised Learning Program for Prospective Technomancers** is non-accredited at any level, but it just might make you a techno wizard if you apply yourself.
