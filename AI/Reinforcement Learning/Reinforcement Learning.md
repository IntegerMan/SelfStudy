## Overview
Reinforcement learning allows agents to discover optimal strategies for problems without relying on training data. These solutions can evolve over time as environments or strategies change.
## Assignments

- Write up or present on the major different reinforcement learning algorithms such as SARSA, Expected SARSA, Q Learning, etc.
- Build a system using Reinforcement Learning to find optimal values
